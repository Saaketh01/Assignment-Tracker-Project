# Assignment Tracker Project

Description:This project implements a Python-based assignment tracker system that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing assignments. The system allows users to add new assignments, delete existing ones, and edit assignments (such as changing the deadline).

Key Features:
Create: Users can add new assignments, providing details like the assignment title, description, and deadline.
Read: Users can view the list of assignments along with relevant details.
Update: Users can update existing assignments, such as changing deadlines or descriptions.
Delete: Users can delete assignments that are no longer required.

Deadline Notifications:
When an assignment deadline is updated, an automatic email notification is triggered to notify the assigned person about the change. This ensures that individuals are always aware of any changes to deadlines.

Technologies Used:
HTML/CSS: Used for the structure and styling of the front-end user interface.
JavaScript & jQuery: Used for adding interactivity, such as updating assignments dynamically on the front-end.
Express.js: The back-end framework used to handle requests, perform CRUD operations, and manage the assignment data.
Node.js: Used as the runtime environment for running the Express.js server.
